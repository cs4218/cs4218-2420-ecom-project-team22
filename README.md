There is a slight difference in config file needed to run the repository for tests versus for development.

### Testing

For testing, simply run the codebase as is with any of the testing scripts.

### Development

To run the application in developer, the `package.json` must be modified. Add

"type":"module"

to the file and then run `npm run dev`
